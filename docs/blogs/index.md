# My Writeups

This section is entirely dedicated to short writeups about the content I am interested in or worked with. I will be adding contents to this once or twice in a week. The content in this may not be correct, and all the content in this section are absolutely written by me.

If you find any errors, feel free to correct me by sending a message in [nadeemsiyam](https://nadeemsiyam.com), or open a pull request.

To open a pull request, [fork the repo](https://github.com/Centinoughty/docs.nadeemsiyam.com/fork), commit your changes and then open a pr to the main branch
