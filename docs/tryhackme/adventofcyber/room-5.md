# AI in Security - old sAInt nick

AI has become a core component of modern cyber security. AI is now used for analysis of system generated logs for finding patterns and malicious activities to reduce human intervension. But, the fact is that you cannot rely on an AI machine 100%. You need to put some effort to validate the response given by your AI agent. AI is now used for red teaming, blue teaming, and software analysis

Modern softwares as part of security and value, generating a huge amount of logs. Manually analysing them is now impractical. AI helps it enhancing speed, scale and contextual understanding.

## Defensive Security

AI agents are used for blue teaming which speeds up the analysis, investigation and response generation. AI could also assist you with generating automated responses, blocking a suspicious email, flagging an unusual login attempt, all in real time.

## Offensive Security

AI agents have made notable impact on the field of offensive security. It made the life of pentesters easier. AI agents are now used for read teaming, for creating and running scripts which could be helpful. This made pentesters spend more time in doing task which require more human touch.

## Software

AI-driven software development has now become a trend in the life of developers. A cool term vibe coding has gained popularity along with the vulnerabilities it creates. AI is now like a companion which helps you giving ideas and maybe helping writing code for you. The scanners audit and analyse the code written by you and analyse the potential vulnerabilties within. Well, it's somewhat ironic, that AI agents are used for identifying vulnerabilities, but are not quite as effective at writing secure code.

## AI in Cyber Security

Should AI be used in cybersecurity? The factors such as AI hallucinations, bias in the training data, lack of transparency in the decision-making, privacy are the major concers for this question. Infact, I would AI should be used and its usage should be controlled. Uncontrolled usage may lead to service disruptions such as overwhelming systems or triggering race conditons. Well, human verification remain essential. AI output must always be reviewed and validated.
