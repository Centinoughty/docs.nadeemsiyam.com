# Try Hack Me

Cybersecurity is something which I always wanted to explore **properly**, not just at a theoritical level but through hands-on practice. As a developer, understanding how systems break is just as important as knowing how to build them correctly.

This marks the beginning of my **TryHackMe journey**, starting today.

## What is this all about?

Here, I will be sharing my room-wise experience and explanations, key concepts I leaned, tools and techniques I used and of course, personal notes and takeawyas.
