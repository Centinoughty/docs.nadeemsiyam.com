## Password Pandemonium

This task asks me to create a password which is strong, and is not in the breached database. Even the password `P@ssw0rd123` has been flagged. I created a password which matches the requirements:

- A password with atleast 12 charecters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Ensure your password is not in the breached database

Strong passwords are one of the most simplest yet most effective defenses against cyber attacks.
