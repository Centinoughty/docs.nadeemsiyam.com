# Advent of Cyber 2025

## Password Pandemonium

This task asks me to create a password which is strong, and is not in the breached database. Even the password `P@ssw0rd123` has been flagged. I created a password which matches the requirements:

- A password with atleast 12 charecters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Ensure your password is not in the breached database

Strong passwords are one of the most simplest yet most effective defenses against cyber attacks.

## The Suspicious Chocolate.exe

Unknown executable files are one of the most common initial infection vectors in real-world attacks. Attackers often disguise malware as music playlists, images, files, etc. Blindly executing this could lead to malware infections, credential theft, or even system compromise.

Here, in this task I used a tool called `VirusTotal` which is used to analyze a file. Its analysis on the file `chocolate.exe` gave me the info of `49` clean results and `1` report flagged the file malicious. Even though 49 engines reported the file safe, that single malicious detection could not be ignored.

Here, `chocolate.exe` should be considered **malicious** and should not be executed.

## Welcome to the AttackBox!

This task is fairly simple, and its main objective is to get familiar with the linux environment and its navigation. Understanding basic commands are important when it comes to cybersecurity workspaces.
